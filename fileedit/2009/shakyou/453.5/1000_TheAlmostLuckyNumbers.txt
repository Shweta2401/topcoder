Problem Statement
    	A lucky number is a number whose decimal representation contains only the digits 4 and 7. An almost lucky number is a number that is divisible by a lucky number. For example, 14, 36 and 747 are almost lucky, but 2 and 17 are not. Note that a number can be both lucky and almost lucky at the same time (for example, 747).



You are given longs a and b. Return the number of almost lucky numbers between a and b, inclusive.
